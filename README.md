# RecipeRecommendations

I love Half Baked Harvest's recipes, link here: https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/. I have a few favourite recipes from the website, but sometimes I want to try new ones. 

I created a program that scrapes the website to grab all the recipes and recipe details. From here, a user (me) pastes a link to a recipe that I currently like, and the program uses KMeans clustering to find similar recipes based on the ingredients list. 

This was a very fun program to make and actually useful in my real life!

Please note that if you want to repurpose the code, youll have to replace the file names with your own paths.
